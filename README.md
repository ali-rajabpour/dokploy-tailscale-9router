# dokploy-9router-private

A hardened [9Router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) deployment for
[Dokploy](https://dokploy.com), reachable only by you. Two access modes,
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) or an SSH tunnel, sharing one stack and one
database.

No public DNS record. No Traefik route. Nothing exposed to the internet.
Nothing about the rest of your server changes.

---

## Why this exists

I run a self-hosted VPS with Dokploy, hosting a number of unrelated production
projects. I wanted 9Router on it: an AI router that fronts Claude Code,
Cursor, Copilot, and friends, giving them fallback across providers and
compressing tool output to save tokens.

Four problems got in the way.

**1. The upstream compose file does not work on Dokploy.** Dokploy routes
traffic through Traefik, which needs Docker labels and a shared network on
every service it serves. The official `docker-compose.yml` has neither, and
it sets `container_name`, which Dokploy's own documentation warns breaks logs
and metrics.

**2. I could not convince myself it was safe to expose.** This is the part
that changed the design. 9Router's SQLite database holds live OAuth tokens for
every provider you connect. Losing it means someone else spending your Claude
and Copilot subscriptions, and walking away with the tokens.

I read the upstream authorization model rather than trusting the README, and
it is genuinely well built: deny-by-default on `/api/*`, JWT on the dashboard,
progressive login lockout, and a set of process-spawning routes restricted to
local callers with client-supplied forwarding headers stripped so they cannot
be spoofed.

But one thing does not go away. The `/v1` endpoint has to stay reachable by
IDEs and CLI tools that speak plain HTTP with a bearer token. No identity proxy
can gate that path without breaking every client. Cloudflare Access, Zero
Trust, an OAuth proxy; all of them end up with a bypass rule on `/v1`, and
you are back to a single API key standing between the public internet and your
provider tokens. Cloudflare Tunnel has a second problem for this workload:
TLS terminates at their edge, so every prompt, every file your agent reads, and
every token passes through their infrastructure in plaintext.

The honest fix is not to expose it at all.

**3. I wanted upstream updates without babysitting.** The usual answer,
Watchtower, wants the Docker socket mounted. On a box running everything else
I own, that is root-equivalent access traded for update convenience. No.

**4. I stop this service when I am not using it.** Restarting had to bring
back the same configuration, the same provider logins, and the same hostname,
not a fresh install asking me to reconnect eleven providers.

Then a fifth problem showed up after the first version shipped: **Tailscale is
filtered where I live.** Not throttled, not slow. The TLS handshake gets an
injected RST the moment the ClientHello carries an SNI under `tailscale.com`,
and since both the control plane and every DERP relay live there, the client
has nowhere to connect. That is what the second access mode is for.

## What this repository does about it

Two ways in. Same containers, same volumes, same security properties. You pick
one by choosing which compose file Dokploy builds.

**Tailscale.** 9Router runs inside a Tailscale sidecar's network namespace.
`tailscale serve` terminates TLS and forwards to it over loopback. Reachable at
`https://9router.<your-tailnet>.ts.net` from your own devices and nowhere else.

```
tailnet ──TLS 443──> [tailscale sidecar] ──127.0.0.1:20128──> [9router]
                            │  (shared netns)                     │
                            └── docker bridge ────────────> [headroom :8787]
```

**SSH tunnel.** No sidecar. The port binds to the VPS's loopback interface, and
you reach it through `ssh -L` from a machine that already has shell access.
Reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:20128` on that machine.

```
client ──SSH──> [vps 127.0.0.1:20128] ──docker bridge──> [9router] ──> [headroom :8787]
```

Common to both:

- **Your host's networking is untouched.** In Tailscale mode `tailscale0`
  exists only inside the container namespace: no root daemon, no rewritten
  `/etc/resolv.conf`, no new firewall chains, nothing left behind if you delete
  the stack. The sidecar runs in userspace mode, so it needs neither
  `NET_ADMIN` nor `/dev/net/tun`. In SSH mode there is no VPN at all.
- **Traefik is not involved.** The label problem disappears rather than
  getting solved.
- **Two layers on every request.** Tailnet membership or SSH credentials,
  then 9Router's own password and API key.
- **Updates poll instead of listening.** A Dokploy scheduled job calls
  Dokploy's own API to redeploy. No Docker socket exposed.
- **State survives.** Named volumes keep the database, provider tokens, node
  identity, and TLS certificate across stop/start cycles, and across a switch
  between the two modes.

### The subtle part

Proxying over loopback is exactly the thing that could have broken this.
9Router grants *local* requests elevated access: `/v1` without an API key,
plus password reset and the process-spawning routes. A naive loopback hop
would hand every visitor those privileges.

In Tailscale mode it holds because `tailscale serve` sets `X-Forwarded-For` to
the client's tailnet address unconditionally (`ipn/ipnlocal/serve.go`,
`addProxyForwardedHeaders`), and 9Router's `custom-server.js` strips any
client-supplied forwarding headers before stamping its own. Remote callers stay
remote:

```
client 100.x → serve (TLS :443) → XFF=100.x, X-Forwarded-Proto=https
  → 127.0.0.1:20128 → strips spoofed headers, stamps x-9r-via-proxy=1
  → isLocalRequest() = false
```

In SSH mode it holds because Docker's userland proxy re-originates the
published connection, so the container sees the bridge gateway address rather
than loopback.

`verify.sh` asserts this after every deploy, in both modes. If those checks
ever fail, the central assumption has broken and you should stop before
connecting providers.

Headroom deliberately stays on the Docker bridge rather than in the shared
namespace. Inside it, that third-party image could reach 9Router over loopback
with no forwarding header and inherit local privileges. On the bridge it is
treated as the remote client it is.

## Which mode should I use?

Default to Tailscale. It is less to run, it gives you a real HTTPS URL that
every client accepts, and tailnet membership is a genuine second gate.

Use SSH if Tailscale cannot connect from your network, or if you would rather
not add a mesh VPN at all. Check first:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' --max-time 10 \
  https://controlplane.tailscale.com/health
```

A status code means Tailscale works. `Connection reset by peer` means an SNI
filter is killing the handshake, and no amount of configuration gets around
it. Take the SSH path.

The trade-off is honest in both directions. Tailscale gives you a real
certificate and a stable hostname; SSH gives you zero extra infrastructure and
survives filtering, at the cost of a tunnel to keep alive on each machine and
no TLS for clients that insist on it.

## Quick start

Create a Dokploy **Compose** project from this repository, set **Compose Path**
to your mode's file, leave **Isolated Deployments off**, add no domain, and set
`JWT_SECRET` and `INITIAL_PASSWORD` in the Environment tab.

**Tailscale mode**, `./docker-compose.yml`:

1. In the Tailscale admin console, enable MagicDNS and HTTPS Certificates, then
   replace the default allow-everything policy with:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "tagOwners": { "tag:nine-router": ["autogroup:admin"] },
     "grants": [
       {
         "src": ["autogroup:member"],
         "dst": ["tag:nine-router"],
         "ip":  ["tcp:443"],
       },
     ],
   }
   ```

   The tag goes in `dst` only. Putting it in `src` as well grants the node
   access to itself and your own machines nothing. On older tailnets that use
   `acls` instead of `grants`, see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for the equivalent.

2. Generate a reusable, non-ephemeral auth key carrying `tag:nine-router`, and
   set it as `TS_AUTHKEY`.
3. Add a Dokploy File Mount with **File Path** `serve.json` and the contents of
   `serve.json` as its content. Mount the file this way rather than from the
   repository, which Dokploy re-clones on every deploy.
4. Deploy, then `./verify.sh https://9router.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`.

**SSH mode**, `./docker-compose.ssh.yml`:

1. Deploy. There is no step 2 on the server.
2. On the VPS, confirm `ss -tlnp | grep 20128` shows `127.0.0.1:20128` and not
   `0.0.0.0:20128`.
3. On each client, `ssh -N -L 20128:127.0.0.1:20128 <user>@<vps>`, or the
   `autossh` service in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for something that survives
   sleep and reboots.
4. `./verify.sh http://127.0.0.1:20128`.

Full instructions, including client configuration for Claude Code and Hermes,
the update job, and how to switch modes later, are in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

> `INITIAL_PASSWORD` is not optional. 9Router falls back to `123456` when it is
> unset.

## Requirements

- A VPS running Dokploy
- **Tailscale mode**: a Tailscale account (the free tier is sufficient) and the
  client installed on each machine. Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android all
  have first-class clients
- **SSH mode**: SSH access to the VPS, and `autossh` if you want the tunnel to
  stay up unattended

## Trade-offs

In Tailscale mode, every device that uses 9Router must be on your tailnet. For
a single-operator setup that is a small cost, but if you need access from a
machine where you cannot install Tailscale, use SSH mode instead.

In SSH mode, the tunnel is a moving part. If it drops, clients get connection
refused rather than a graceful error. There is also no TLS for clients that
require an `https://` base URL, and the security boundary becomes your SSH
configuration, so key-only authentication is not optional.

Tracking `:latest` with an unattended redeploy means an upstream compromise
reaches your provider tokens without review. Pin a version tag and drop the
scheduled job if that trade is not one you want.
